## Grunt Tasks
Several common task have been preconfigured to help with development. In the command line run one the following task.  In most cases you will only need to run the default task.

* **Default** - General purpose and best for all around development

        grunt
  1. Runs JSHint against your JavaScript Code to maintain coding standards

  2. Runs JasmineJs unit test

  3. Compiles Sass to CSS

  4. Start your  web server on [localhost port 4000](http:/localhost:4000)

  5. Start file watcher.  Saved local changes to JavaScript and Sass will call the appropiate task to rerun and restart the web server
*(optional) If you have livereload running page will auto refresh.*

* **JavaScript Only** - Runs only the JavaScript related task listed above.  Use this only if you are not making any style changes. No new CSS will be generated by this task

        grunt devScript

* **CSS/Sass changes only** - Use this if you are only making changes to Sass files.

        grunt devStyle

* **Install Grunt globally** - install grunt-cli

        npm install -g grunt-cli

* **Test only** - To Run unit test only

        grunt test

* **Check-in ready** - This will run JSHint but not allow development helpers such as _console_ or _debugger_

        grunt dist

* Markup Validation - Check for validation errors in HTML files.  Run this before checking in changes.  Not all warnings are valid. Confer with other team member to determine which warnings merit fixing or ignoring.

You may need to supply height and width for the element using these images for backgrounds.

To add new images to the map, add to the "themes/default/img/icons" subfolders (General, TopNav, LeftNav). Compiling the Sass files will add the new class to the CSS.

### Font Icons.

There are 3 set of font icons. The Font names came be found at ""
1. Glyphicons - set that comes with bootstrap
2. Medicons - Set of custom general purpose icons
3. Honda specific icons.
 Custom sass mixins have been created for each set.  Each is designed to be apply on a selector. Does not require any addition to the markup. The font name doesn't need the "icon-" prefix.
For Medicons use icon-font($font-name, [$font-size], [$color], [$position])
ex. The following would add the icon-eye to all H2's
```Sass
        h2{
            icon-font(eye);
        }
```
For Honda specific icons use mixin  nav-icon-font($font-name, $font-size, $color, $position)
ex. The following would add the icon-scale to all elements with classes *someClass* and *anotherClass*. The icon would be purple on elements with class *anotherClass*.
```Sass
        .someClass{
            nav-icon-font(scale);
        }
        .anotherClass{
            nav-icon-font(scale,$color: purple);
        }
```

For Bootstrap's icons you may used as described on the documentation or use the mixin bs-icon-font($font-name, $font-size, $color)
This mixin doesn't include a position parameter like the other mixins.
```Sass
        .someClass{
            bs-icon-font(music);
        }
```


# noUiSlider

noUiSlider is lightweight plugin, developed to be a jQuery UI alternative. It features cross-browser support, a `just-another-input-type` style of getting and setting values, a wide range of options and support for a bunch of touch devices. It works wonders on Android phones, iPhone & iPad, Windows phone and touch-screen laptops and tablets. It works excellent on the desktop too; All modern browsers and IE7+ are supported. The end result? A lean, extendible and bloat-less plugin that'll just do its job. To add even more flexibility, noUiSlider is compatible with both jQuery and Zepto.js.

# angular-nouislider

(http://refreshless.com/nouislider/) plugin. Demo is [here](http://vasyabigi.github.io/angular-nouislider/).

### Usage:

- Install: `bower install angular-nouislider`
- Add `jquery`, `angular`, `nouislider` and `angular-nouislider` to your 

code:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/nouislider/jquery.nouislider.css" />
<script src="bower_components/jquery/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/nouislider/jquery.nouislider.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/nouislider/Link.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular-nouislider/src/nouislider.js"></script>
```

- Add a dependency to the `nouislider` module in your application.

```js
angular.module('MyApp', ['nouislider']);
```

- Add a `slider` attribute to your `<div>` tag:

```html
<div slider ng-model="test.single" start=1 end=10></div>
<div slider ng-from="test.from" ng-to="test.to" start=0 end=100 step=5></div>
```

- If you wanna change [callback function]

(http://refreshless.com/nouislider/slider-events), use `callback` 

attribute. (`slide` by default.)

```html
<div slider ng-model="test.single" start=1 end=10 callback='change'></div>
<div slider ng-from="test.from" ng-to="test.to" start=0 end=100 step=5 callback='set'></div>
